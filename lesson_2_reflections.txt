What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, Git will be able to track changes in that directory. However, you still 
need to make a commit in order to start the tracking of files in that directory. Initializing a repository 
is required for being able to track changes in files using Git. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area stages files to be grouped together for a commit.
Allows you group more than one file together to make a commit, this is useful
when one file is related in some way to another file. Making it so changes in
one file could make an impact on another file, therefore you'd want to make a 
commit with both of these files together.
